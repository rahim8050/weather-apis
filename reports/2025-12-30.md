## Daily Report — Tue, Dec 30, 2025 (EAT)
### Codebase: DRF backend — `~/projects/weather-apis`

### Done
- Verified TLS certificate SANs include `DNS:localhost` and IPs (`127.0.0.1`, `172.25.121.28`).
- Identified WSL → Windows path correction needed when copying certs (`/mnt/c/Users/rahim/...` vs placeholder path).
- Logged integration failure clearly: DRF returned `{"detail": "Invalid Nextcloud signature"}` during signed request testing.

### In progress
- Root-causing signature mismatch:
  - Canonical string consistency (path, method, headers, body handling).
  - Timestamp/nonce formatting and drift tolerance.
  - Ensuring reverse proxy doesn’t mutate any signed components.

### Next
- Produce one deterministic “known-good” signed request that passes end-to-end.
- Confirm proxy headers and upstream routing are aligned with what DRF expects (host/proto/forwarded headers).
- Decide dev TLS trust approach (private CA trusted by OS/browser vs self-signed per-machine).

### Blockers
- Browser still warns despite correct SANs (likely trust chain / cached cert / CA not trusted).
- Signature mismatch blocks authenticated integration flow.

### Links / Evidence
- `openssl x509 -in /etc/nginx/tls/baby_server.crt -noout -text | grep -A2 "Subject Alternative Name"`
- DRF response observed: `Invalid Nextcloud signature`
