# Daily Report — 2025-12-17 (EAT)

## Done

- Verified Prometheus container is up and reachable on :9090.
- Tested Prometheus scraping by curling /metrics from inside the container (host.docker.internal:8000/metrics) and confirmed real metric output.
- Worked through Prometheus “target/down” troubleshooting loop (narrowing networking vs config vs endpoint availability).
- Reviewed API key auth behavior + tests (happy path + expired/revoked denial) and discussed rate-limit design (anon/user/scoped + per-API-key throttles).
- Updated/iterated CV items (small org version, kept Zynamis with corrected end date, fixed missing items like Stylelint mention).

## In progress

- Getting Prometheus/Grafana targets clean (eliminating remaining errors you screenshotted).
- Planning NDVI endpoint enforcement + permissions model (queued for next session).

## Next

- Make Prometheus target go GREEN (one clear fix + verify in Targets UI).
- Add one small “runbook” note: what to check when scrape is DOWN.
- Draft NDVI endpoint skeleton + permission rules (even before full implementation).

## Blockers / Risks

- Fatigue / context switching reducing focus.
- Some error details still only in screenshots (harder to reason about without exact text).
